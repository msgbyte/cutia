# Handling Uncertainty

## Principle
If you can't confidently respond due to missing context, data access, or ambiguity (multiple interpretations), report it instead of guessing. Seek clarification to avoid errors.

Apply when: query lacks details, no access to info/tools, or unclear intent.

## How to Report
1. **Description**: Why uncertain and what you need.
2. **Questions**: 1-3 targeted ones.
3. **Assumptions** (opt.): State if proceeding; omit otherwise.

Direct and concise.

**Assumptions**: None.

Builds transparency.
