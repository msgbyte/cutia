# Readability First

Optimize code for AI agents to understand and modify.

Never abbreviate. `event` not `e`, `element` not `el`. If it's easy to read, it's correct. In this case, "config" is better than "configuration" because it's shorter and is **still very readable**. "El" is not very readable.
